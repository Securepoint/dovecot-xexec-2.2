Build Instructions
------------------

To build the xexec plugin for dovecot, you need to have your dovecot
source and build directories. (Note that they generally are the same.)

Untar this tarball under dovecot's source src/plugins directory.
In the dovecot build directory, run:
  ./config.status --file=src/plugins/xexec/Makefile depfiles
  make -C src/plugins/xexec
  make -C src/plugins/xexec install
Enjoy!
